              Welcome to the Foodbank App. Our mission is to help manage food
              donations and distributions efficiently and effectively. We strive
              to support communities by ensuring that food reaches those in need
              in a timely and organized manner.

              Our app provides tools for both employees and receivers to manage
              inventory, track donations, and distribute food efficiently.
              Employees can easily add and track food items, while recipients
              can register and choose their preferred food options.
